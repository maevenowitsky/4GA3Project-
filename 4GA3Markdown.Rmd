## Introduction 

  Vancouver is usually ranked as one the most sustainable as the city tries to move toward a zero-carbon emission city, the role of urban greeny became more important than ever. Urban green space plays an important role in creating liveable spaces and helping to maintain the well-being of the majority of residents. In addition,  Urban green spaces can reduce many climate change impacts, support urban ecology, improve property values, and increase social interactions (Nesbitt et al., 2019). The relationship between urban green space and socioeconomic factors in the city of Vancouver can be complex and multifaceted. The distribution of urban green space is inequitable in some cities (Nesbitt & Meitner, 2016). Equitable access to urban green space is often associated with higher levels of well-being, particularly among disadvantaged and lower socioeconomic groups. In this report, Vancouver is chosen because it has high resolution urban green space data and socioeconomic data available. It aims to explore the relationship between accessibility to green space and socioeconomic factors across different census subdivisions in Vancouver, Canada.

## Background

## Study Area

This study took place at the Census Subdivision level to target the municipality of Vancouver, BC. There are 127 census tracts in Vancouver that were studied. 

```{r}
# storing the API key in system environment to be easily used in API calls
options(cancensus.api_key = "CensusMapper_ff4c917e80df34b71900e0a048c999dd")
```

```{r}
# assigning a persistent local cache
options(cancensus.cache_path = here::here("Project data"))
Sys.setenv(CM_CACHE_PATH = here::here("Project data"))
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# returning census data and geography for the Vancouver CMA as an sf-class dataframe
census_data <- get_census(dataset='CA21', regions=list(CSD="5915022"), vectors=c("v_CA21_1","v_CA21_386","v_CA21_906", "v_CA21_4875", "v_CA21_4914", "v_CA21_1010"), labels="detailed", geo_format="sf", level='CT')
```

```{r}
# removing columns that are not needed for analysis
census_data <- census_data[,-c(4,5,9,10,13,15,16)]
```

```{r}
# renaming the columns in the dataset
names(census_data) [1] <- "Shape_area_km2"
names(census_data) [3] <- "Number_of_households"
names(census_data) [4] <- "Region_name"
names(census_data) [7] <- "Number_of_dwellings"
names(census_data) [10:15] <- c("Population_2021", "Average_age", "Median_total_income_of_household_2020", "Total_visible_minority_population", "Not_a_visible_minority", "Low_income_status_for_the_population_in_private_households_2020")
```

## Data

  The data used for analysis includes census data for variables of population, population density, visible minority status, non-visible minority status, and income for each census tract in the census subdivision of Vancouver. This data was obtained from Statistics Canada through use of the cancensus package in R. All census data used is from the 2021 census. Point data for each the location of each park, homeless shelter, and street tree in the census subdivision was downloaded in a .csv file format from the City of Vancouverâ€™s open data portal. To use the r5r package so that accessibility to parks by both walking and public transit could be determined, a road network dataset of Vancouver, and as well as a public transport feed of the city was needed. The road network dataset was obtained from BBBike, and was stored as a .pbf file. The public transport feed was obtained from Transitland and stored in a GTFS.zip file. 

## Methods

  To determine the relationship between greenspace and other socioeconomic factors in Vancouver, Rstudio was used to analyze and visualize the variables being examined. Choropleth maps for variables of population, population density, visible minority status, non-visible minority status, and income, and accessibility to parks were made to provide a visual representation of the difference between census tracts. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the independent variable studied (number of parks accessible within a 30 minute travel time) and dependent variables (population, population density, visible minority status, non-visible minority status, and income). Scatterplots were used to show a visual representation between independent and dependent variables studied to better understand the results of regression analysis. 

## Results

To begin our analysis, the centroids for each census tract in the Vancouver CSD were obtained and put into a dataframe with latitude, longitude, and census ID. This allowed us to have point data describing the middle of each CT.

```{r include=FALSE}
# obtaining centroids for census tracts in the Vancouver CSD 
CT_centroids <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(census_data))
#converting centroids to data frame
centroids_df <- as.data.frame(CT_centroids)
class(centroids_df)
centroids_df<- cbind(centroids_df, census_data$GeoUID)

centroids_df <- centroids_df %>% 
                    rename("lon" = "X",
                           "lat" = "Y",
                           "id" = "census_data$GeoUID")

```

```{r}
# calculating population density for the census tracts in Vancouver
census_data <- census_data %>%
  mutate(Population_density =
           (Population_2021 / Shape_area_km2))
```

```{r}
# calculating the proportion of the minority population and adding to census_data
census_data <- census_data %>%
  mutate(Proportion_visible_minority= (Total_visible_minority_population / Population_2021))
```

```{r}
# calculating the proportion of the non visible minority population and adding to census_data
census_data <- census_data %>%
  mutate(Proportion_nonvisible_minority= (Not_a_visible_minority / Population_2021))
```

```{r}
# calculating the proportion of low income status in Vancouver census tracts
census_data <- census_data %>%
  mutate(Proportion_low_income = (Low_income_status_for_the_population_in_private_households_2020 / Population_2021))
```

The point data for park in the Vancouver CSD was obtained from a csv file from Vancouver's open data portal and transformed into a data frame with columns describing the X and Y coordinates of each park.

```{r}
# reading csv files
parks <- read.csv(file = "Project data/parks.csv", head = TRUE, sep = ";") 
```

```{r}
#extracting point data from park csv file
parks_coord <- data.frame(do.call("rbind", strsplit(as.character(parks$GoogleMapDest), ",", fixed = TRUE)))

# Rename multiple columns
parks_coord <- parks_coord %>% 
                    rename("X" = "X1",
                           "Y" = "X2")
```

The point data for parks was prepared for use of the r5r package by renaming columns for latitude, longitude, and park ID data and to the names required by r5r. Data for latitude and longitude was converted into a numeric format. Lastly, a column to indicate that each park point was one singular park was added to meet the requirement of the opportunities parameter in r5r.  

```{r include=FALSE}
#preparing park data for r5r
class(parks_coord)
parks_coord<- cbind(parks_coord, parks$ParkID)

# renaming columns
parks_coord <- parks_coord %>% 
                   rename("lat" = "X",
                          "lon" = "Y",
                          "id" = "parks$ParkID")

# changing columns to numeric
parks_coord$lon <- as.numeric(parks_coord$lon)
parks_coord$lat <- as.numeric(parks_coord$lat)
```

```{r}
parks_coord <- parks_coord %>%
  add_column(Parks_count = 1)
```

Next, the r5r package was used in order to build a transport network for Vancouver, so that the distances and routing between the centroids of census tracts and park locations can be calculated.

```{r}
#allocating RAM memory to Java to use the r5r package
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx2G")
```

The transport network was built with using a road network dataset of Vancouver, and as well as a public transport feed of the city. The road network dataset was obtained from BBBike, and was stored as a .pbf file. The public transport feed was obtained from Transitland and stored in a GTFS.zip file.

```{r include=FALSE}
#building transport network for r5r
path <- file.path("Project data/r5rpath")

#building transport network for r5r
list.files(path)
r5r_core <- setup_r5(data_path = path)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
#load origin points as the centroids of census tracts
points <- centroids_df
class(points)
#points of interest: parks
poi <- parks_coord
#departure times
departure_datetime <- as.POSIXct("16-02-2023 14:00:00",
                                 format = "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S")

```

The accessibility function in r5r was used to compute how many parks were accessible within 30 minutes of each census tracts centroid by walking or public transit.

```{r include=FALSE}
#using accessibility from r5r
access <- accessibility(r5r_core = r5r_core,
                        origins = points,
                        destinations = poi,
                        opportunities_colnames = c("Parks_count"),
                        mode = c("WALK", "TRANSIT"),
                        departure_datetime = departure_datetime,
                        decay_function = "step",
                        cutoffs = 30)
```

Once the number of accessible parks was calculated, this was added to the data frame displaying census data.

```{r}
census_data <- cbind(census_data, accessibility = access$accessibility)
```

After all variables were in one data frame and prepared for analysis, data was first visualized by creating choropleth maps for each variable of interest. Maps were created for each variable as follows, beginning with creating a choropleth map for the 2021 population:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# creating a choropleth map for the 2021 population
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = census_data,
          aes(fill = cut_number(Population_2021, 5)),
          color = "black",
          size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") +
  ggtitle("Population of Each Census Tract") +
 theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "right",  
        legend.box = "horizontal",  
        legend.key.width = unit(0.5, "cm"),  
        legend.key.height = unit(0.5, "cm")) 
```

\newpage

Next, creating a choropleth map for the population density of each census tract.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# creating a choropleth map for the population density
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = census_data,
          aes(fill = cut_number(Population_density, 5)),
          color = "black",
          size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") +
  ggtitle("Population Density of Each Census Tract") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "right",  
        legend.box = "horizontal",  
        legend.key.width = unit(0.5, "cm"),  
        legend.key.height = unit(0.5, "cm")) 
```

\newpage

Now creating a choropleth map for the proportion of the visible minority population.

```{r}
# creating a choropleth map for the proportion of the visible minority population
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = census_data,
          aes(fill = cut_number(Proportion_visible_minority, 5)),
          color = "black",
          size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of the Visible Minority Population") +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "right",  
        legend.box = "horizontal",  
        legend.key.width = unit(0.5, "cm"),  
        legend.key.height = unit(0.5, "cm")) 
```

\newpage

Creating a choropleth map for the proportion of the non-visible minority population.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# creating a choropleth map for the proportion of the non-visible minority population
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = census_data,
          aes(fill = cut_number(Proportion_nonvisible_minority, 5)),
          color = "black",
          size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Non-Visible Minority Population") +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "right",  
        legend.box = "horizontal",  
        legend.key.width = unit(0.5, "cm"),  
        legend.key.height = unit(0.5, "cm")) 
```

\newpage

Creating a choropleth map displaying the proportion of low-income areas.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# creating a choropleth map displaying the proportion of low-income areas.
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = census_data,
          aes(fill = cut_number(Proportion_low_income, 5)),
          color = "black",
          size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Population Considered Low-Income for Each CT") +
 theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "right",  
        legend.box = "horizontal",  
        legend.key.width = unit(0.5, "cm"),  
        legend.key.height = unit(0.5, "cm")) 
```

\newpage

Finally, a choropleth map was created to display the independent variable, parks accessible within 30 minutes of a centroid. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
# creating a choropleth map displaying the number of parks accessible to a census tract's centroids within 30 minutes
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = census_data,
          aes(fill = cut_number(accessibility, 5)),
          color = "black",
          size = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd") +
  ggtitle("Number of Neighbourhoods Accessible Within 30 Minutes") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "right",  
        legend.box = "horizontal",  
        legend.key.width = unit(0.5, "cm"),  
        legend.key.height = unit(0.5, "cm")) 
```

\newpage
Next, to determine the relationship between the number of accessible parks and each independent variable, the independent variables were regressed to number of accessible parks for each CT.

```{r results='asis'}
#creating a regression model of population regressing on number of accessible parks
model_population <- lm(formula = Population_2021 ~ accessibility, 
             data = census_data)

stargazer(model_population,
          header = FALSE,
          title = "Population of Census Tracts regressed on Number of Parks Accessible")
```

For each regression, a scatter plot was created to provide a visual representation of the data.

```{r}
ggplot(data = census_data, 
       aes(x = accessibility, 
           y = Population_2021))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x,
              method = "lm") +
  ylab("Population (2021)") +
  xlab("No. of Parks Accessible within 30 Minutes (walking or public transit)") 
```

\newpage
