\#Introduction

\#Background

\#Study Area

This study took place at the Census Subdivision level to target the
municipality of Vancouver, BC. There are 127 census tracts in Vancouver
that were studied.

\#Data

\begin{verbatim}
The data used for analysis includes census data for variables of population, population density, visible minority status, non-visible minority status, and income for each census tract in the census subdivision of Vancouver. This data was obtained from Statistics Canada through use of the cancensus package in R. All census data used is from the 2021 census. Point data for each the location of each park, homeless shelter, and street tree in the census subdivision was downloaded in a .csv file format from the City of Vancouverâ€™s open data portal. To use the r5r package so that accessibility to parks by both walking and public transit could be determined, a road network dataset of Vancouver, and as well as a public transport feed of the city was needed. The road network dataset was obtained from BBBike, and was stored as a .pbf file. The public transport feed was obtained from Transitland and stored in a GTFS.zip file. 
\end{verbatim}

\#Methods

\begin{verbatim}
To determine the relationship between greenspace and other socioeconomic factors in Vancouver, Rstudio was used to analyze and visualize the variables being examined. Choropleth maps for variables of population, population density, visible minority status, non-visible minority status, and income, and accessibility to parks were made to provide a visual representation of the difference between census tracts. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the independent variable studied (number of parks accessible within a 30 minute travel time) and dependent variables (population, population density, visible minority status, non-visible minority status, and income). Scatterplots were used to show a visual representation between independent and dependent variables studied to better understand the results of regression analysis. 
\end{verbatim}

\#Results

\begin{verbatim}
To begin our analysis, the centroids for each census tract in the Vancouver CSD were obtained and put into a dataframe with latitude, longitude, and census ID. This allowed us to have point data describing the middle of each CT.
\end{verbatim}

The point data for park in the Vancouver CSD was obtained from a csv
file from Vancouver's open data portal and transformed into a data frame
with columns describing the X and Y coordinates of each park.

The point data for parks was prepared for use of the r5r package by
renaming coulumns for latitude, longitude, and park ID data and to the
names required by r5r. Data for latitude and longitude was converted
into a numeric format. Lastly, a column to indicate that each park point
was one singular park was added to meet the requirement of the
opportunites parameter in r5r.

Next, the r5r package was used in order to build a transport network for
Vancouver, so that the distances and routing between the centroids of
census tracts and park locations can be calculated.

The transport network was built with using a road network dataset of
Vancouver, and as well as a public transport feed of the city. The road
network dataset was obtained from BBBike, and was stored as a .pbf file.
The public transport feed was obtained from Transitland and stored in a
GTFS.zip file.

The accessibility function in r5r was used to compute how many parks
were accessible within 30 minutes of each census tracts centroid by
walking or public transit.

Once the number of accessible parks was calculated, this was added to
the data frame displaying census data.

After all variables were in one data frame and prepared for analysis,
data was first visualized by creating choropleth maps for each variable
of interest. Maps were created for each variable as follows:

Population of each CT

\includegraphics{4GA3Markdown_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-23-1.pdf}

Population density of each CT

\includegraphics{4GA3Markdown_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-24-1.pdf}
Proportion of population identifying as visible and non-visible
minorities

\includegraphics{4GA3Markdown_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-25-1.pdf}

\includegraphics{4GA3Markdown_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-26-1.pdf}

The proportion of the population considered low income for each CT

\includegraphics{4GA3Markdown_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-27-1.pdf}

Finally, a choropleth map was created to display the independent
variable, parks accessible within 30 minutes of a centroid.

\includegraphics{4GA3Markdown_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-28-1.pdf}

Next, to determine the relationship between the number of accessible
parks and each independent variable, the independent variables were
regressed to number of accessible parks for each CT.
